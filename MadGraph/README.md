# MadGraph

## Tasks

 - [ ] Generate Signal jH with different pT threshold
   - [ ] Generate 1 MEvent jH with pT(Higgs) > 50 GeV
   - [ ] Generate 1 MEvent jH with pT(Higgs) > 150 GeV
 - [ ] Generate 1 MEvent background jGammaGamma (not sure that MadGraph, possibly Sherpa)
 
Cards will be stored in `Cards` directory.
 

## Install MadGraph and all components outside of this repository:

* Download **MadGraph5_aMC@NLO** from official site: [MadGraph site](http://madgraph.physics.illinois.edu/)
* Unpack it: 
``` 
tar -xvvf MG5_aMC_v2.6.3.2.tar.gz
```
* Run MadGraph: 
```
MG5_aMC_v2_6_3_2/bin/mg5_aMC 
```
* Inside MadGrap install Pythia8, Delphes, ExRootAnalysis and lhapdf6 
(In principle tab helps to make a choice of available programs. If something is missing for installation, you will get help information; please, follow it.):
```
install pythia8
install Delphes
install ExRootAnalysis
install lhapdf6
```
ExRootAnalysis you need to generate root-file directyly (not lhc-file).

## Generate Higgs --> GammaGamma in MadGraph:

* Login to MadGrap:
```
MG5_aMC_v2_6_3_2/bin/mg5_aMC
```
* Load model (**you have to load model each time if you generate/launch card**):
```
import model heft-full
```
* Generate process (a is a gamma in MadGraph):
```
generate p p > h > a a
```
* Add additional processes to have Higgs with non-zero pT:
```
add process p p > h j, h > a a
```
* Generate cards in the directory (DirName = HiggsJet, for example)
```
output DirName
```
* Run command to edit cards:
```
launch
```

**Be careful:** If you press `Enter` it will go to next step automatically.

* After you sould switch on processes, 
by typing corresponiding numbers 
(The `analysis = ExRoot` should be on itself):
```
shower = Pythia8
detector = Delphes
```
* Press Enter and type to modify run\_card.dat:
```
1 = ickkw     ### by default it is 0, it turn on jet matching
20.0 = xqcut  ### by default it is 0 
lhapdf    = pdlabel     ! PDF set *isModified*
263000    = lhaid     ! if pdlabel=lhapdf, this is the lhapdf number NNPDF30_lo_as_0130 *isModified*
```
`xqcut` sets the minimum kt jet measure between partons. 
Changing this value will cause you to keep more or
fewer Higgs bosons. You can play with it if you want.

Change pdflabel to `lhapdf` and use pdif `263000`, what corresponds to `NNPDF30_lo_as_0130`.

You also could change number of generated events there (10K events by default).

* Don't edit the param\_card.dat

* Edit pythia\_card.dat. 
`qCut` must  be larger then `1.5 xqcut` in the run card.
Add in the end of the file:
```
JetMatching:qCut = 20.0
JetMatching:nJetMax = 1 ! max number of jets
```
* Donâ€™t edit delphes\_card.dat

* When you are done editing the card files, MadGraph will begin generating the processes by pressing `Enter`.
Once it finishes you will have a root-file that is stored in /Events/run 01/ in the directory you created at the beginning.

* How to get high pT Higgs only:

Since we can only apply cut at parton level, the Higgs for the process
p p > h > a a
has ALWAYS  a zero pt.

If you want to put a cut on the pt of the Higgs, you need to at least
include one jet (probably more) at parton level. and therefore do

p p > h j , h > a a 
in that case, you can use either 
XXX = ptheavy 
or the 
 {25: XXX} = pt_min_pdg

Note that 
1) You should want to have a softer pt cut that the one of your analysis (since the pt of the Higgs will be modified by the parton-shower
2) You might want to (at least) use MLM to have the spectrum correct
3) Note that heft is not valid when the Higgs pt is larger than the top mass. So you will need either a model with the full loop contracted or use the loop induced mode of MG5aMC
